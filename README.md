### BIS015L WQ24 Repository  
Hi!  

Welcome to my repository, where I plan to store the work I create as a student currently taking the BIS015L (Data Science for Biologists) course at UC Davis. Specifically, in this repository, you will find my class materials and assignments organized into folders based on the lab session they correspond to. I hope you are able to get just as much out of looking at these materials as I was able to, while creating them.
