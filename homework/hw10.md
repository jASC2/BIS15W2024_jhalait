## Desert Ecology
For this assignment, we are going to use a modified data set on [desert ecology](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/). The data are from: S. K. Morgan Ernest, Thomas J. Valone, and James H. Brown. 2009. Long-term monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near Portal, Arizona, USA. Ecology 90:1708.

```r
deserts <- read_csv("../lab11/data/surveys_complete.csv") %>% clean_names()
```

```
## Rows: 34786 Columns: 13
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (6): species_id, sex, genus, species, taxa, plot_type
## dbl (7): record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, hindfoot_length, weight
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

1. Use the function(s) of your choice to get an idea of its structure, including how NA's are treated. Are the data tidy?  


```r
glimpse(deserts)
```

```

Yes, the data are tidy as NAs have been assigned to missing values and each column records data for a specific variable.

2. How many genera and species are represented in the data? What are the total number of observations? Which species is most/ least frequently sampled in the study?


```r
#How many genera are represented:
deserts %>%
  count(genus)
```

```
## # A tibble: 26 × 2
##    genus                n
##    <chr>            <int>
##  1 Ammodramus           2
##  2 Ammospermophilus   437
##  3 Amphispiza         303
##  4 Baiomys             46
##  5 Calamospiza         13
##  6 Callipepla          16
##  7 Campylorhynchus     50
##  8 Chaetodipus       6029
##  9 Cnemidophorus        2
## 10 Crotalus             2
## # ℹ 16 more rows
```


```r
#How many species are represented:
deserts %>%
  count(species) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species          n
##    <chr>        <int>
##  1 merriami     10596
##  2 penicillatus  3123
##  3 ordii         3027
##  4 baileyi       2891
##  5 megalotis     2609
##  6 spectabilis   2504
##  7 torridus      2249
##  8 flavus        1597
##  9 eremicus      1299
## 10 albigula      1252
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```

There are 34,786 observations (based on the results of the glimpse function), which can be organized into 26 unique genera and 40 unique species. Of the species, merriami is most represented and clarki, scutalatus, tereticaudus, tigris, uniparens, and viridis tie for the least number of observations (1).

3. What is the proportion of taxa included in this study? Show a table and plot that reflects this count.


```r
deserts %>%
  count(taxa) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 × 2
##   taxa        n
##   <chr>   <int>
## 1 Rodent  34247
## 2 Bird      450
## 3 Rabbit     75
## 4 Reptile    14
```


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=taxa))+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->


4. For the taxa included in the study, use the fill option to show the proportion of individuals sampled by `plot_type.`


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=taxa, fill=plot_type))+
  geom_bar()+
  scale_y_log10()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

5. What is the range of weight for each species included in the study? Remove any observations of weight that are NA so they do not show up in the plot.


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=species, y=weight, fill = taxa))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = T)+
  coord_flip()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

6. Add another layer to your answer from #5 using `geom_point` to get an idea of how many measurements were taken for each species.


```r
deserts %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(n_measurements = n()) %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=species, y=n_measurements))+
  geom_point(na.rm = T)+
  coord_flip()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

7. [Dipodomys merriami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam's_kangaroo_rat) is the most frequently sampled animal in the study. How have the number of observations of this species changed over the years included in the study?


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(species == "merriami") %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=year))+
  geom_bar()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

The number of observations appears to have oscillated over the years.

8. What is the relationship between `weight` and `hindfoot` length? Consider whether or not over plotting is an issue.


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+
  geom_point(na.rm = T)
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=weight, y=hindfoot_length))+
  geom_jitter()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 4048 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

Plotting does appear to be somewhat problematic here, even after attempting to differentiate the points using 'geom_jitter().'

9. Which two species have, on average, the highest weight? Once you have identified them, make a new column that is a ratio of `weight` to `hindfoot_length`. Make a plot that shows the range of this new ratio and fill by sex.


```r
deserts %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(avg_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = T)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_weight))
```

```
## # A tibble: 40 × 2
##    species      avg_weight
##    <chr>             <dbl>
##  1 albigula          159. 
##  2 spectabilis       120. 
##  3 spilosoma          93.5
##  4 hispidus           65.6
##  5 fulviventer        58.9
##  6 ochrognathus       55.4
##  7 ordii              48.9
##  8 merriami           43.2
##  9 baileyi            31.7
## 10 leucogaster        31.6
## # ℹ 30 more rows
```

The species albigula and spectabilis have the highest average weights.


```r
deserts %>%
  filter(species %in% c("albigula", "spectabilis")) %>%
  mutate(w_to_l_ratio = weight/hindfoot_length) %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=species, y=w_to_l_ratio, fill=sex))+
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = T)+
  coord_flip()
```

![](hw10_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

10. Make one plot of your choice! Make sure to include at least two of the aesthetics options you have learned.


```r
deserts %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=plot_type, fill=taxa))+
  geom_bar()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title="Plot Type Usage by Taxa",
       x="Plot Type",
       y="Frequency")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=rel(1.5), hjust=0.5))
```
